# TDD Connect Four for The Odin Project
Saving was added as a little extra after the project was completed so this isn't true TDD as spec files have not been created for this feature. This may be added at a later date.

The Connect 4 Game Rules are easy to understand. In fact, it is in the name. To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four of your tokens in a row, much the same as tic tac toe. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one token at a time. This will give you a chance to either build your row, or stop your opponent from getting four in a row.
